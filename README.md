# dTerra Base

A collection of base terrains, created for use in Enfusion/Arma: Reforger, masks are freely available to use and modify, the source to generate these masks will not be provided; if you wish to generate different masks, tools such as World Machine, GeoGen and the entirely free option blender exist. I am unable to provide any support for the height maps, I'm mostly fedup of playing on Landlocked maps and constantly seeing the ocean below the map when flying.
